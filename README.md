# belly-button-challenge
Challenge 14

This code uses Javascript and html to generate a webpage that displays the results of a study conducted on the bacteria in human belly buttons. 

You can use the dropdown menu to select the id of a person in the study.  When you select their number, their demographic information will show under the dropdown box, their top 10 bacteria and values will show on the bar chart, and the amount of each of their bacteria will update on the bubble chart.  Hover over any bar or bubble to see the name of the bacteria charted.  

This code was created using a combination of examples from class activities and chatgpt.
